    <p class="one">CSpathshala <a href=https://cspathshala.org >(https://cspathshala.org) </a>proudly announces the third conference on Computational Thinking in
      Schools (CTiS2022) from 29th September to 2nd October 2022 at School of Scholars, Nagpur. Owing to the pandemic the conference will be held in the virtual format.
      The CTiS (Computational Thinking in Schools) conference is an annual event organised by the ACM (Association of Computing Machinery) and the CSpathshala community. It aims to bring together teachers, educators and researchers to discuss issues of curriculum, pedagogy, policy and implementation, related to bringing computational thinking to schools.
      The first CTiS conference was held in Pune in April 2019 and the second conference was held in virtual mode in October 2020. Both were greatly successful and were well received by teachers and educators.

      CTiS2022 aims to provide a platform for teachers, educators and experts to share their best practices as well as challenges faced in implementing computational thinking in education. The discussions will focus on integrating CT activities (both plugged and unplugged) in various school subjects, on student learning outcomes and on disseminating findings of CT based experiments or classroom research conducted by teachers and educators across the country. The conference will feature keynote speeches, workshops, panel discussions and paper presentations on various themes related to Computational thinking.
    </p>
    <h3>Paper Presentation</h3>
    The conference attempts to cover a wide range of topics on Computational thinking and its implementation in the school curriculum. These include, but are not limited to:
