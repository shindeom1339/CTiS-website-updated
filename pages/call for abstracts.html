      <p class="one">CSpathshala <a href=https://cspathshala.org>(https://cspathshala.org)</a> proudly announces the
        fourth conference <strong>on <a href="https://event.india.acm.org/CTiS/">Computational Thinking in Schools (CTiS2022)</a> on 8th and 9th July, 2022 at IISER, Pune and hosted by Kaveri Group of Institutes - Dr. Kalmadi Shamarao High Schools, Pune</strong>. Owing to the pandemic, the conference will be held in hybrid format with in-person participation encouraged to the extent possible. <br><br>
        The CTiS (Computational Thinking in Schools) conference is an annual event organised by the ACM, India (Association for
        Computing Machinery, India) and the CSpathshala community. It aims to bring together teachers, educators and
        researchers to discuss issues of curriculum, pedagogy, policy and implementation, related to bringing
        computational thinking to schools. <br><br>
        CSpathshala is an ACM India initiative to bring a modern computing curriculum to Indian schools. In our National
        Education Policy 2020 and in many countries across the world, Computational Thinking (CT) has been identified as
        one of the essential subjects to be taught and a critical skill to be developed in children during the school
        years. It advances the notion that the Mathematics and Science behind Computer Science go far beyond the simple
        ability to use computers, and can be taught and discussed in schools even without the use of computers. The
        first CTiS conference was held in Pune in April 2019, the second and third editions of the conference were held
        as virtual events in October 2020 and September 2021 respectively. All three editions were greatly successful and were well received by teachers and educators. <br><br>
        <strong>CTiS2022</strong> aims to provide a platform for teachers, educators and experts to share their best practices as well as
        challenges faced in implementing computational thinking in education. The discussions will focus on integrating
        CT activities both plugged and unplugged (with or without the use of computers) in various school subjects, on
        student learning outcomes and on disseminating findings of CT based experiments or classroom research conducted
        by teachers and educators across the country. The conference will feature keynote speeches, workshops, panel
        discussions and paper presentations on various themes related to Computational thinking. <br><br>

      <p class="one">One of the primary objectives of the CTiS2022 is to elicit the practising teacher’s views and understanding
        with regard to CT. The paper presentation session welcomes interested participants to submit an abstract (not
        exceeding 1000 words) on any of the above themes (though not restricted to the above themes). Participants are
        encouraged to focus their presentation on sharing their own work and experience related to CT. Please refer to
