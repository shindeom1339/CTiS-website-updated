            </b></p>
        <p>When IIT Madras decided to launch an online BSc programme in Programming and Data Science, one of the challenges was to teach programming at scale to students from diverse backgrounds.  We decided to begin with a course on computational thinking before embarking on learning programming formally.

            We based the course on extracting useful information from concrete datasets -- students' report cards, shopping bills and paragraphs of text.  Through this, we introduced computational thinking concepts -- iteration, variables and filtering -- and also explained how to express these concepts using flowcharts and pseudocode.  Along the way, we also introduced data structures like lists and dictionaries to maintain and process information, and explained the use of abstractions like graphs and recursion to navigate complex relationships and hierarchical structures.
            
            An orthogonal challenge was to deliver this content in an engaging manner online.  To simulate an interactive classroom discussion, we structured the lectures as a conversation between the two instructors.  The datasets were printed on cards and several computations were executed by hand using these cards. The feedback from learners to this approach has been very positive.
